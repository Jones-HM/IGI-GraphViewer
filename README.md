# Project IGI Graph Viewer

This is **Project IGI Graph Viewer**which generates the *3D graph* of the game using the graph data file.
This is usefule for the game developers to understand the graph data and visualize it in a better way by selecting the graphs for level it can show information of Graph _Nodes,Positions,Areas,Links,Edges and Material._ data which helps to understand the game data in a better way.

## 💻 Technologies Used 💻

This project uses the following technologies:

- Python
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Pandas

## 🔥 Features 🔥
-**Generate 3D graphs**(Scatter, Line, Mesh) from `.dat` files like `Graph4019.dat`.</br>
-**Analyze**Nodes, Graphs, Areas, Links, Edges from the data file.</br>
-**Display**table format of Graph Areas and Nodes, showcasing their position and material.</br>
-**Draw legends**for data visualization.</br>
-**User-friendly settings**for customization.</br>

With these features, you can easily visualize and analyze the data from Project IGI in a user-friendly and customizable way. The ability to generate 3D graphs and display data in a table format allows for a deeper understanding of the game's data. The user-friendly settings make it easy to customize the visualization to your needs. Overall, this web app provides a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing Project IGI data. 😊

## 📖 Usage 📖

To use this web app, you need to upload single or multiple graph files and select the settings from the settings window. The Graph will be generated and if you need help selecting a graph file then select the game settings and select the level. You can also select `Show Area table` from `View Settings` to understand the Graphs Area.

## 📝 Graphs - Generator 📝
There are different types of graphs available like *Scatter, Line, Mesh*. You can select the type of graph from the `Graph Settings` window. And draw graphs like this.
-**Graph Type Circle**</br>
